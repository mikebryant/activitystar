# activitystar
An adaption of ActivityStreams / ActivityPub to p2p, using Earthstar

## Status

General musings at present...

## Why?

Why use activities / activitypub as a base?
- It offers the potential for some neat bridging, where you can run a relay that speaks both activitypub and earthstar, and anyone who opts in can have their feeds published on activitypub, or conversely can follow people in the fediverse.
- It means less reinventing the wheel - don't need to think about what a Note means, use the existing definitions.

## Naming?

ACTIVITYpub + earthSTAR

Naming is hard. Tell me if you have a better idea :D

Two bits at present:
- [The p2p protocol](p2p)
- [Some ideas on federation](federation)
